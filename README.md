## About

This is a small educational project I started in my free time, outside of working hours.  
I’m using it as a way to learn more about **low-level programming on x86 architectures** and to experiment with building the early foundations of a simple operating system.  

There’s no commercial goal behind it — it’s just a personal learning project meant to improve my programming skills and help me grow as a developer.
